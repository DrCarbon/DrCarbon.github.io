Another semester draws to a close, and with it ends this short, yet significant, journey. I have gained a multitude of skills and experiences, all of which, I have found infinitely interesting and intriguing, yet at the same time I am unsure as to how I will use them.  It is impossible to say how what I have learned in this course will effect me in the future, however, I can say with certainty, that this course has changed my perspective on codeing, and has made the field all the more exciting.     

One of the first concepts we were introduced to in this course was functional programming, a type of programming based around keeping computations as succinct as possible through specialized functions.  We experienced this type of programming with the underscore library, a collection of functions that perform relatively simple computations, but reduce it down to one line of code.  making what could be several lines of code, only one or two lines goes a long way in making the code more efficient and easier to read. 

Learning functional programming was rather difficult however, and I found myself struggling with it quite a lot in the beginning. The hardest hurdle for me was the memorization aspect of functional programming, since this method of programming uses functions to focus on computations, there are large libraries of specialized functions for me to use.  We used the Underscore library in this course, and the hardest part was probably learning how to implement it, and then when it came time to using it, when to implement certain functions.  I eventually got the hang of it, and our instructor forcing us to use this functions instead of having if statements in our code, certainly made things initally much harder, but as I continued to learn I gained an appreciation for how streamlined code became when you properly use functional programming.  This lesson was the hardest due to how unintuitive it was, and how much effort was put into learning it, however at the end the benefit of being able to use functional programming in my own code is well worth it. 

The lessons I learned in this class 

As I think back on my experience with Semantic UI I can certainly say that it achieves what it wanted to, I found it to be an easy to learn tool that offered a good array of stylistic options that made my website pages look slick and professional.  While I had my gripes with how the UI reacted to some style changes, I think that overall this is a good UI to use for a solid professional website.

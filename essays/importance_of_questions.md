    When it comes to communication, asking questions is key to making sure everyone understands what is going on and what needs to be done.  As such, knowing how to ask questions as a software engineer is an important skill, after all, if your question just wastes time or confuses your fellow team members, then it is simply an ineffective question.  An effective, or smart question, is one that gives as much necessary information as possible, and clearly defines what the person asking the question wants to know.  After all, you can’t fix anything until you know what the actual problem is.  Since asking these smart questions is important to any field, especially software engineering, I have gone onto Stack Overflow to search for examples of smart and poor questions, to better understand how a question succeeds or fails.

    The best way to learn is through making mistakes, especially if those mistakes were made by others.  It didn’t take long to find a poor question on stack overflow and thus I took it and begin to analyze it to try and figure out where the developer went wrong.  This question I found had one major flaw that I could immediately detect, it was simply too broad.  The developer gave a basic overview of what he wanted: assistance in figuring out how to store data  from his datatable to his SQL Database.  He did not provide much more information besides this, not even his code or what the errors were, as such his question was put on hold.  A lesson that can be taken from this is that being specific is important, if a software engineer were to ask a broad question, I assume we’d see a similar reaction to the comments on this Stack Overflow thread, asking the developer to clarify what he means.  Without that kind of clarity, people can’t begin tackling the issue to help you solve it.
    
     Moving on from this question, I began to search for a smart question, and when I did, I could easily see the difference between it and the poor question from earlier.  The developer who posted this question clearly presented his problem, he detailed what was going wrong with his program, what version of Ruby he was using as well as the error message he was receiving.  Unlike the last question, he supplied information that was relevant and useful to the people he was asking. As I saw in the comments, because of the clarity he gave, it seemed like those that responded were able to give a more detailed analysis of what was wrong and offer their own explanations on how to fix it.  Even if the solution in the end was that was just to switch versions, seeing how he presented his question showed me how helpful giving a clear and detailed question could be.

    Seeing the difference between a poor question and a smart question really did help give myself a perspective on how to construct questions myself.  It is also through looking up these online examples that I truly got to see just how much of a hinderance a poor question can be, while a smart question actually helps everyone understand the problem and generate ways to solve it.  While I think it’s impossible to really determine what is and isn’t a smart question, I think taking the principles of clarity, information, and explanation go a great deal in making a question better than one without those elements.

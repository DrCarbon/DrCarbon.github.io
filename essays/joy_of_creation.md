There is something wholly rewarding about the act of creation.  There is a sense of pride and accomplishment that comes with completing any
creative project.  For me, I have always enjoyed creation, it served as an outlet and a mode of self expression that still affect me and 
even some others, to this day. To me, software engineering seems like the natural progression for my creative interests.  It is an 
extremely powerful tool, one with limitless creative potential that can be used in so many ways, be it an app, game, or scientific program. 

It is that freedom that is the most exciting aspect of software engineering, the limit is your imagination.  I already have ideas of what 
I would like to do with this knowledge, but they are broad and undefinited just like how I am just beginning to learn, not yet able to see 
the big picture. No doubt, that as I continue my education in software engineering, I will be able to see in greater clarity, what I can do
and how I can take on projects that currently seem so daunting and intimidating to me.  I am interested in creating programs, apps, 
simulations, games, anything that people can use or enjoy but I don’t know where to start but the biggest step is coming up with an idea. 
However, no matter how amazing an idea I come up with, it will mean nothing if I have no way to communicate it to other people, especially 
if I expect those people to help me make this idea a reality.
    
Communication is a key skill in any workplace environment, knowing what to do and what is wrong can be key deciding factors in the success 
or failure of any project. It is for this reason that I am excited to begin learning how to coordinate and program in a team.  When dealing
with code the slightest mistake can throw the entire program off, and a simple miscommunication between team members could easily amplify 
any of those problems.  What’s intriguing to me, is learning how to deal with problems of the program as the team; how will we split up the
work and decide what needs to be done?  It sounds like a great challenge, but one that I’m sure will be a fun and valuable to overcome.

Even if I don’t go into a field that has to do with software engineering, what I find most interesting about this course so far, is that I 
can already see the applications general life as a whole.  There is an incredible amount of flexibility that comes with learning about 
software engineering, and perhaps it is that flexibility that I find so alluring. I am extremely excited to continue delving further into 
this course, using what I learn and applying it to not only my life, but the hundreds of projects in the future that I have to even begin 
creating.

During the game design course I took in my senior year, I was assigned to a group of two other members: a fellow ICS Student and an ACM student. We were given about 2 and a half months to create a video game that would be presented to the class. We were given no parameters on what the game should be and were given complete freedom to create what we wanted. Our team first worked together creating a brainstorm for our video game, with each team member supplying an idea which we used to create a singular game concept. We then decided what needed to be done and splitthe work between us to be as balanced as possible.

The game idea we landed upon was a puzzle platformer where a Martian astronaut, following an accident with an elevator, is trying to climb the elevator shaft to reach his family before they take off in a rocketship. It's a 3D platformer that utilizes a special mechanic  

I was mainly assigned to level and puzzle design, though I also worked heavily on the enemy AI, button and platform scripting, central game mechanic, even some animation, and directing the project. Despite the work load being spread evenly, I chose to take on more tasks than I was given because I was passionate about the project and had high expectations for the finished product.

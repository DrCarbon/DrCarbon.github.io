In this project I decided to set out to create a castle in Minecraft that would be as accurate and defensible as a castle found in the real world.  I set to work first laying out the foundations and strategic points that could be used for defense using historical castle designs as context.  I also decided to take inspiration for my towers and crenelations from different European designs, mainly French castle design.

I am quite happy with how this project turned out and I certainly learned a lot about ancient medieval castle design, even picking up ways to improve future castles I create, be it in Minecraft, or different program entirely.  In fact, while researching for this project I was inspired by plenty of things that I found interesting about these ancient fortresses, and even made me interested in making a game of sorts, centered around castle structure and design.
